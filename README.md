A.SMART TRAFFIC LIGHTS 
In this module, there are 2 parts. The automatic traffic light and the barrier-integrated traffic light.
For the automatic traffic light, this Project has used a Raspberry Pi 4 board and we have connected it to the LED on the breadboard and set a timer value for the glow of each light. 
During the barrier integration, This Project uses a servo motor to connect to the board using jumper wires. Then the coding part is completed, to integrate the servo motor to the board, then the barrier is attached. 
Now the barrier is integrated into the Raspberry Pi 4 board and moves according to the change in traffic light. When the red light is on, the barrier drops, and when the green is on it rises.
Also the presence of a traffic density checker using the camera strives to prove the fact that the traffic light system is intelligent. 
Using the camera attached to the Raspberry Pi board we recognize the traffic density to do this in real-time we use the YOLO (you only look once) algorithm. 
The algorithm helps in identifying the lanes with heavy traffic density and helps to adjust traffic signals such that the heavy traffic density lane will have reduced red signals and the lanes with less traffic will have an increased red signal.
In this module, we are going to attach a sound sensor to the Raspberry Pi 4 board, which in turn will be connected to the servo motor. 
The sound sensor senses the siren sound and controls the barrier to not drop and cause a delay in the path. The sensor is set in such a way that when the ambulance is within the vicinity of 100 meters, the siren is sensed and the barrier is held till the ambulance crosses the signal. 
C.THE SMART STREET LIGHT SYSTEM
The functionality and unique features of a sophisticated street lighting system will determine its output. 
The following are the lighting control system's outputs: The system may turn on or off the lights based on preset schedules, motion sensing, and ambient light levels. 
Energy efficiency: The system can lower its energy use by adjusting illumination levels or shutting off lights when not in use. 
Surveillance along with reporting: The system may provide comprehensive reports and analytics and monitor energy consumption, lighting consumption, and other parameters.
Signals and reminders: The system can send out notifications to users in response to certain occurrences, such as when a lightbulb requires to be repaired or when energy use is above pre-established limits.
